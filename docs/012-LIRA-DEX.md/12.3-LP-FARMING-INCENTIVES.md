### LP Farming Incentives

The LIRA DEX implements a unique method for distributing farming incentives that ensures sustainability and stability within our ecosystem. Unlike traditional decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that calculate rewards based on the fiat value of staked liquidity provider (LP) tokens, LIRA DEX uses a system that ties rewards directly to the number of LDT tokens represented by the LP tokens in staking. This approach mitigates the risks associated with fiat value fluctuations and provides a more stable reward mechanism.

## Reward Calculation Method
The core principle of our reward distribution system is to issue a precise amount of tokens based on the quantity of LP tokens in staking. All reward calculations are based on the number of LDT tokens, not their fiat value. This means that regardless of market volatility, the rewards remain consistent and predictable.

## Reward Funds
The reward funds for LP farming on LIRA DEX are structured as follows:

- **TB Rewards Fund:** This fund consists of 40% of the 80% initial total supply of TB tokens.
- **LDT Rewards Fund:** This fund is composed of 20% of the 20% initial total supply of LDT tokens, as detailed in our distribution page.

These reward funds are distributed based on the quantity of tokens staked in liquidity pools, rather than their fiat value. This method ensures that rewards are fairly distributed among participants, encouraging sustained engagement and participation in the ecosystem.

## Advantages of Our System

Traditional DEXs often distribute rewards based on the fiat value of staked tokens. This can lead to several issues:

- **Hyperinflation:** When token prices decrease, more tokens are issued to match the fiat value of rewards, leading to an increased supply and further downward pressure on the token price.
- **Hyperdeflation:** When token prices increase, fewer tokens are issued, potentially creating a supply shock and excessive price volatility.

Our system avoids these pitfalls by tying rewards directly to the quantity of LDT tokens. This approach offers several key benefits:

- **Stable Supply Management:** By issuing rewards based on token quantity rather than fiat value, we maintain a more predictable and stable supply of circulating tokens.
- **Sustainable Market Dynamics:** Our reward distribution method helps prevent the hyperinflation or hyperdeflation of the token, fostering a more sustainable market environment.

The LP farming incentives on LIRA DEX are designed to provide a balanced and sustainable reward mechanism that benefits all participants. By focusing on token quantity rather than fiat value, we create a system that promotes long-term stability and avoids the common pitfalls of traditional DEX reward structures. This innovative approach ensures that our ecosystem remains robust and resilient, supporting the growth and development of the LIRA DEX.
