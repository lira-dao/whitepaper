# Meme Factory Tool
The Meme Factory is an innovative decentralized exchange (DEX) tool designed to facilitate the creation and trading of memecoins. This platform empowers users with minimal technical skills to create their own tokens effortlessly and securely. Hereâ€™s an overview of its key features and processes:

## Automated Token Creation and Launch
The Meme Factory offers an intuitive tool for automated token creation. Users simply need to input their desired token parameters, and the system handles the rest. This streamlined process ensures that even those without programming expertise can generate their own memecoins with ease. Additionally, the platform automates the presale and the initial liquidity pool launch for the newly created tokens on the Meme Factory DEX.

## Presale and Launch of Yoshi Token
To kickstart the Meme Factory, there will be a presale phase for its native token, the Yoshi Token. This presale phase is a crucial period where early participants can acquire Yoshi Tokens before the official launch.

Following the presale, the Yoshi Token will be launched, and a corresponding liquidity pool will be opened. This marks the beginning of the active trading phase for Yoshi Tokens and other memecoins created on the platform.

## Ensuring Security Standards
One of the core features of the Meme Factory is its commitment to security. All tokens created through the platform must adhere to specific security standards predefined by the Meme Factory. This ensures that the memecoins generated are robust and reliable, mitigating risks such as rug pulls.

## Incentives for Liquidity Providers
The Meme Factory incentivizes liquidity provision in unique ways. When a memecoin is created using the Meme Factory and paired with LDT, liquidity providers who deposit and stake their LP tokens will receive Yoshi Tokens in addition to the memecoin rewards. This dual reward system encourages active participation and liquidity provision within the LIRA ecosystem.

Conversely, memecoins paired with Ethereum do not offer Yoshi Token rewards. Liquidity providers in these pools can only utilize their LP tokens on other platforms.
