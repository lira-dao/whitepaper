# Fueling Innovation and Community Growth

The LIRA Launchpad serves as a launchpad (pun intended) for the future of DeFi, fostering innovation and propelling the LIRA ecosystem towards continued growth. This chapter explores the functionalities and advantages offered by the Launchpad, highlighting its role in empowering Web3 projects and fostering a thriving community.

### A Gateway for Promising Projects
The LIRA Launchpad functions as a springboard for promising companies and projects seeking to enter the dynamic realm of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs). It provides a platform for these ventures to conduct presales, secure funding, and gain valuable exposure within the LIRA ecosystem.

### Presale Power with TB Staking
The Launchpad prioritizes community involvement and fosters inclusivity. Presale opportunities are available to community members who actively participate in Treasury Bond (TB) staking on the platform. This incentivizes long-term commitment and empowers dedicated LIRA supporters to participate in the ground floor growth of promising projects.

### Democratized Project Selection
The LIRA DAO, a cornerstone of the LIRA ecosystem's decentralized governance, plays a crucial role in project selection for the Launchpad.  Through a transparent voting process, the community actively participates in selecting projects to be launched, ensuring democratic decision-making and fostering a sense of ownership within the LIRA community.

### Beyond Presales: Fostering Symbiotic Growth
The Launchpad's value proposition extends beyond facilitating presales. By integrating Web3 projects into the broader LIRA ecosystem, it creates a mutually beneficial environment.  Users gain access to innovative projects and potentially lucrative staking opportunities, while the integrated projects benefit from exposure to a large and engaged user base. This fosters a symbiotic relationship that contributes to the collective success of both the LIRA ecosystem and the participating Web3 projects.

### A Commitment to the Future
The LIRA Launchpad embodies the core values of the LIRA ecosystem: innovation, collaboration, and democratization.  By empowering promising projects, fostering community involvement, and promoting the integration of Web3 technologies, the Launchpad plays a critical role in shaping the future of DeFi and propelling the LIRA ecosystem towards continued growth and prosperity.

### Participation in Presale
Users can participate in presales based on the total value in ETH of their staked Treasury Bonds (TB) on the LIRA DEX, plus any applicable boosts. This ensures that participants with significant stakes are rewarded with early access to promising new tokens.

### Access to Airdrop Suite
Users can access the Launchpad Airdrop Suite through the staking of LDT tokens on the Launchpad. The more LDT tokens staked and the longer the staking period, the more tokens the user will receive in airdrops. This incentivizes long-term commitment and provides a fair distribution of new tokens to active participants.

### Project Requirements for Presale
Every project that utilizes our Launchpad for their token presale must reserve 1% of their total token supply for LDT stakers on the Launchpad. These tokens are placed into a vault, which ensures their distribution over the course of one year. Every 24 hours, tokens are released from the vault and distributed to users who have staked LDT on the Launchpad.
