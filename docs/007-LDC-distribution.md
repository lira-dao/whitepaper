# Fueling the Ecosystem

### Building a Sustainable Future: LDC Distribution Strategy
The distribution of newly minted LIRA DAO Coin (LDC) is meticulously crafted to ensure resources are allocated strategically across various key areas within the LIRA DAO Ecosystem. This approach fosters long-term sustainability and incentivizes active participation from all stakeholders.

### Initial Allocation: Treasury Takes Center Stage
Following the initial burning of a predetermined portion of minted LDC tokens, the remaining supply is divided into two primary allocations. A significant portion, **80%**, is reserved for the minting of Treasury Bond (TB) tokens. These TB tokens play a vital role within the ecosystem, offering holders the opportunity to stake their LDC and earn additional rewards. This incentivizes long-term commitment and fosters a vibrant community of engaged users.

The remaining **20%** of LDC is distributed strategically within the LIRA ecosystem to support various initiatives.

## A Breakdown of LDC Distribution
Let's delve deeper into the specific breakdown of the remaining 20% of LDC:

**Treasury Bond (TB) Token Staking (40%):** As mentioned earlier, a substantial allocation is dedicated to incentivize TB token staking. This encourages long-term participation and rewards users for their commitment to the ecosystem.

**Liquidity Provider (LP) Staking (20%):** To ensure a healthy and stable financial environment, a portion of LDC is allocated to liquidity mining activities. This incentivizes users to contribute to the liquidity pools, fostering a smooth and efficient flow of transactions within the LIRA protocol.

**DAO Fund (14%):** To empower the community and facilitate effective governance, a significant allocation is dedicated to the DAO Fund. These resources finance essential services, decision-making processes, and various operational expenses within the LIRA DAO.

**Team Allocation (10%):** In recognition of the project team's ongoing efforts and dedication, a portion of LDC is allocated to the team. This allocation ensures the team has the resources necessary to continue developing and maintaining the LIRA protocol at the highest level.

**Green Energy Producers (5%):** Reflecting the LIRA ecosystem's commitment to sustainability, a portion of LDC is allocated to green energy producers. This allocation supports green initiatives and underscores the importance of environmentally conscious practices within the cryptocurrency industry.

**Marketing (1%):** To raise awareness and attract new users, a small allocation of LDC is dedicated to strategic marketing campaigns. These resources will fuel initiatives that promote the LIRA project and its innovative offerings to a wider audience.
