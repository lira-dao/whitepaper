# Anchoring Stability and Growth in the LIRA Ecosystem

### Introducing Treasury Bond (TB) Tokens: Pillars of a Thriving Ecosystem
Treasury Bond (TB) tokens serve as the cornerstone of a robust and sustainable LIRA DAO Ecosystem. These innovative tokens are intrinsically linked to LIRA DAO Coins (LDC) through smart contracts, playing a vital role in amplifying the ecosystem's value and stability.

### Three Tiers of TB Tokens: Catering to Diverse Needs
TB tokens come in three distinct categories – TB Gold (TBg), TB Silver (TBs), and TB Bronze (Tbb) – each representing a specific value in LDC. This tiered structure caters to a wider range of investors and facilitates participation within the ecosystem.

TB tokens categories:

- **TBg** (*Gold*): Representing a larger holding, each TBg token embodies a value of **1,000,000.00 LDC**.
- **TBs** (*Silver*): Offering a mid-tier option, each TBs token holds a value of **100,000.00 LDC**.
- **TBb** (*Bronze*): Providing an accessible entry point, each TBb token is valued at **10,000.00 LDC**.

### Inflation and Deflation: A Community-Driven Approach
TB tokens empower the community to influence the overall supply of LDC in circulation. Through a well-defined governance process within the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), participants can vote on the allocation of LDC for TB token creation. This empowers the community to strategically adjust the LDC supply based on the ecosystem's needs, fostering adaptability and long-term sustainability.

### Minting TB Tokens and Secure Storage
A portion of newly minted LDC blocks is automatically allocated towards the creation of TB tokens, with a specific breakdown:

- **50%**: Allocated for TB Gold (**TBg**) creation
- **30%**: Allocated for TB Silver (**TBs**) creation
- **20%**: Allocated for TB Bronze (**Tbb**) creation
These newly minted TB tokens are then securely stored within a designated vault managed by smart contracts, ensuring their integrity and transparency.

### Distribution of TB Tokens and Benefits
The distribution of TB tokens and their associated benefits are carefully structured to incentivize participation and fuel ecosystem growth:

- **40%**: Dedicated to TB LP Farming, rewarding users who contribute to liquidity within the ecosystem.
- **25%**: Allocated to the LIRA Ecosystem Reward Division, incentivizing active participation and fostering overall growth.
- **10%**: Directed towards the LIRA DAO Fund, supporting essential services and ongoing DAO operations.
- **10%**: Allocated to the LIRA Team, ensuring continued development and maintenance of the ecosystem.
- **10%**: Offered as additional incentives to attract and reward ecosystem participants.
-  **5%**: Awarded to green energy social mining producers, reinforcing the LIRA ecosystem's commitment to sustainability.

### A Dynamic Ecosystem
The implementation of Treasury Bond (TB) tokens introduces a powerful mechanism for fostering stability and growth within the LIRA DAO Ecosystem. By enabling strategic inflation or deflation of the LDC supply, promoting liquidity, and incentivizing participation, TB tokens lay the foundation for a thriving and sustainable community-driven ecosystem.
