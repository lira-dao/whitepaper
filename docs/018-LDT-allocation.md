title: LIRA DAO TOKEN Emission Schedule
---

The strategic allocation of the LDT token supply plays a pivotal role in fostering the LIRA ecosystem's growth and development. This chapter explores the distribution plan for the 10 billion pre-minted LDT tokens, highlighting how they incentivize participation across both the Arbitrum (ARB) chain and the future LIRA CHAIN.

### LDT Token Distribution: A Multi-Faceted Approach
The 10 billion LDT tokens are strategically allocated to incentivize user activity and community engagement across various stages of the LIRA ecosystem's development:

- Presale Allocation (1 Billion):  As detailed in the previous chapter, 1 billion LDT tokens are dedicated to the LDT presale on Arbitrum.  This allocation provides an opportunity for early adopters to acquire tokens and become instrumental in launching the LIRA ecosystem.

- Incentive Programs (4.5 Billion):  The remaining 9 billion LDT tokens are divided equally into two blocks of 4.5 billion each.  These blocks are specifically designated to fuel user engagement and platform adoption on both the ARB chain (pre-LIRA CHAIN) and the future LIRA CHAIN. The second 4.5 Billion tokens block will be burned on the Arbitrum chain and minted as LDC in the LIRA CHAIN. 

### Incentivizing Activity on the ARB Chain
The initial 4.5 billion token block is allocated to incentivize activity on the ARB chain, serving as a springboard for early ecosystem growth.  These tokens will be distributed according to a predetermined vesting schedule:

- 45% in Year 1:  A significant portion (45%) of the tokens allocated to the ARB chain will be distributed in the first year.  This initial surge of incentives aims to stimulate early user adoption and platform usage.

- Decreasing Distribution Over Time:  The remaining tokens will be distributed in decreasing percentages over a five-year period: 25% in year two, 15% in year three, and a further 15% split between years four and five (7.5% each year).  This measured approach ensures a sustained flow of incentives while promoting long-term user engagement.

### Future Incentives on LIRA CHAIN
The second 4.5 billion token block is reserved for incentivizing activities on the LIRA CHAIN once it's established.  The specific distribution schedule for this block will mirror the one implemented on the ARB chain, ensuring a consistent approach to rewarding user participation across both platforms.

### Detailed Incentive Programs: A Dedicated Chapter
The specific mechanisms for utilizing these allocated tokens to incentivize user behavior will be outlined in a separate chapter.  This dedicated focus ensures a clear and comprehensive understanding of how LDT token holders can benefit from their participation in the LIRA ecosystem.

By strategically allocating LDT tokens and implementing well-defined vesting schedules, the LIRA ecosystem fosters a user-centric environment that rewards active participation and fuels ongoing growth on both the ARB chain and the future LIRA CHAIN. This multi-faceted approach lays the foundation for a thriving and sustainable decentralized financial ecosystem.
