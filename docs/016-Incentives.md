title: Ambassador Program - Incentives
---

The LIRA ecosystem thrives on a foundation of active community engagement. This chapter explores the multifaceted incentive programs designed to empower Ambassadors and users, fostering a collaborative environment that fuels the LIRA ecosystem's continued growth.

## Champions of Decentralized Finance
The Ambassador program introduces a pivotal role within the LIRA ecosystem, one dedicated to fostering community expansion and engagement. Ambassadors act as passionate advocates, collaborating closely with the LIRA team to spread awareness of the ecosystem's offerings and extend invitations to prospective members. This initiative harnesses the collective power of dedicated individuals who share a passion for advancing the principles of Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

### Earning While Contributing: Ambassador Rewards
Ambassadors are eligible for a comprehensive reward system.  A dedicated pool, sourced from 10% of the total token supply allocated for staking rewards, incentivizes active participation.  This ensures equitable distribution of rewards among participating Ambassadors.

To qualify for the program, Ambassadors must maintain an active Treasury Bond (TB) token staking position for a minimum of 6 months.  This requirement fosters a sense of commitment and aligns Ambassador interests with the long-term success and stability of the LIRA DAO ecosystem.

### Multi-Tiered Referral System: Spreading the Word and Sharing the Rewards
Ambassadors have the opportunity to earn substantial rewards through a tiered referral system. This system recognizes the value of their network and incentivizes them to onboard new users. Here's how it works:

- Level 1 Referrals (Direct Invites): Ambassadors earn a 5% commission on the profits generated from their direct invitee's TB token staking activities.
- Level 2 Referrals (Second-Degree Network): The reach extends beyond direct invites. Ambassadors also earn a 3% commission on profits generated from staking activities of users invited by their direct referrals.
- Level 3 Referrals (Extended Network): Expanding the network even further, Ambassadors receive a 2% commission on profits from staking activities of users invited by their second-level referrals.

It's important to note that **these rewards come from a dedicated incentive pool, not directly from user profits**.  This ensures a sustainable and fair reward structure while motivating Ambassadors to actively promote the LIRA DAO ecosystem.

### Welcome Bonus: Encouraging Long-Term Commitment

The Ambassador program goes beyond referral rewards.  To incentivize onboarding users who actively participate in the ecosystem, Ambassadors receive a one-time bonus when an invited user commits to staking at least 1 TB token for 6 months. This bonus will be 10% of the value of the locked staking by the referred user and will be paid in LDT. This structure encourages Ambassadors to not only expand the user base but also foster long-term engagement through staking.

## User Incentives: A Rewarding Ecosystem Experience
The LIRA DAO ecosystem welcomes new users with open arms and a robust incentive program. Users who join through an ambassador's referral link will receive a 10% bonus in LDT on their first 6-month locked staking of TB. These rewards, sourced from the same 10% allocation for staking rewards, acknowledge and incentivize user participation, fostering a community spirit of shared success.

### Unlocking Multi-Level Rewards: The Ambassador Upgrade Path
For users seeking to maximize their earning potential, the Ambassador program offers an upgrade path.  By transitioning to Ambassador status, users gain access to referral rewards on the second and third tiers, allowing them to benefit from the activities of their extended network.  This upgrade typically involves a fee, which can be seen as an investment in unlocking greater earning potential within the LIRA DAO ecosystem.

### Building a Vibrant Community: The Power of Incentives
By implementing a comprehensive incentive structure that rewards both Ambassadors and users, the LIRA DAO ecosystem fosters a collaborative and mutually beneficial environment.  This user-centric approach empowers community members to contribute to the LIRA ecosystem's growth while enjoying the rewards of their participation.  Through this commitment to shared success, the LIRA DAO ecosystem cultivates a thriving community that fuels its continued evolution and advancement in the ever-evolving DeFi landscape.
